      <h3>Vlad the Impaler</h3>
        <p>The legend of vampires goes all the way back to the 14th century. According to Bram Stoker, Count Dracula was named after Vlad Cracul, also known as Vlad the Impaler.
          Vlad Dracul was born in Transylvania, Romania. He ruled Walachia, Romania off and on from 1456-1462. He was discribed as being just, although brutally cruel who fought off
          the Ottoman Empire. Vlad the Impaler earned his nickname because he favorite way to end the lives of his enemies was to impale their bodies on wooden stakes while enjoying
          dining with his dying victims, dipping his bread in their blood.</p>

        <h3>Vamires in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century</h3>
          <p>The stories of Vampires have greatly changed over the centuries. Today there are many different variations of how a person becomes a vampire and how vampires live.
            Various tv shows and movies about vampires are booming! Although they are entertaining, they each differ a bit about the stories and history of vampires. People have
            embraced the idea of becoming or being a vampire. <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60713-d310571-Reviews-The_Vampire_Tour_of_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html">The Vampire Tour of San Francisco</a> in the
            beautiful and quiet neighborhood of Nob Hill in San Francisco, CA shows real-life examples of the lives and culture people are living as "vampires" in the beautiful bay area city. Some say it's ridiculous.
            Some are believers. Some are skeptics. Most don't know what to believe so they shy away from the topic, but are entertained by and eager to see the latest and greatest new and upcoming vampire movies and tv shows
            as they open.
