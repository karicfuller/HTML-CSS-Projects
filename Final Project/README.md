Hi there! This is a portfolio site that I put together where you can find information about me, my career and where to find my coding projects. 
Oh yeah, and don't forget the goofy picture and hysterical meme. 

I am currently taking a Software Developer Bootcamp at The Tech Academy. After learning the basics of HTML and CSS this has been the most challenging 
project yet.

We still have some JavaScript learning to do which I will update the site with as we move forward. It's going to be fantastic!

I hope you like it, and be sure to check in from time to time to see the updates and the coding I've learned!
