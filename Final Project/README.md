Hi there! This is a portfolio site that I put together where you can find information about me, my career and where to find my coding projects. 
Oh yeah, and don't forget the goofy picture and hysterical meme. 

I am currently taking a Software Developer Bootcamp at The Tech Academy. So far I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.

I have been using applications such as Visual Studio and PyCharm to help learn these fundamentals of coding.

I hope you like it, and be sure to check in from time to time to see the updates and the coding I've learned!
