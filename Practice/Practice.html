            <h2>The Vampire Diaries <time>9:00</time>pm to <time>10:00</time>pm</h2>
            <p>Although Vampire Diaries targets a younger crowd it does entertain me as an "adult".
                It's a dramatic story about a group of high school kids encountering a vampire named Stephan, attempting
                to pose as a high school student. Elena, whos parents had died weeks earlier, meets Stephan on the first day 
                of school their junior year.

            <h2>The Twilight Saga</h2>
            <p>Yet another vampire story targeting the younger enthusiasts, the Twilight Saga enthralled
                adults as well, all over the world. Twilight starts with Bella, a senior in high school, who almost
                immediately falls in love with Edward, a vampire attempting to blend in with the rest of the high school
                kids at a small town high school in Forks, WA.
