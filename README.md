HTML and CSS projects for Tech Academy Bootcamp
This repository is to house HTML and CSS projects for The Tech Academy Bootcamp course. Information and projects here can be referrenced for coding information moving forward throughout the course. Various types of HTML and CSS will be displayed within this repository starting at the beginning, basic level. 

Some of the projects included are:

Space Station Project 

This project is named index.html. I customeized the Space Station project to a website for DWI USA which is a hommade hand soap company. I used HTML and images which were customized with CSS for both the HTML and image animation.

Movie Theater Site

For this project I created a homepage for a Movie Theater site. I used Bootstrap templates to create the site. It includes a navigation bar with links to various sections of the site, a jumbotron, drop downs, and form cards.  

Various Projects

You will also find various smaller projects that were used to test both HTML and CSS. These are not websites per se, just practice and learning of the various HTML and CSS features.
